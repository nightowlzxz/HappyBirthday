            Today is <b>November 23, 2024</b>, and the day has finally come to
            which you will spend your special day. You told me before that
            you don't do anything special for your special day, so later on
            this day, we'll havng out!1!!1!

            I know I kinda seemed like a bitch at first (inaway kita, 
            remember?) but I want you to know na I never really meant
            it in a way that I was mad. Trust me, it's just na wala pa
            akong tulog that night, and Angela really made my day even worse.
            pero just know that I never blamed you for anything.
            
            Today was such a fun day, you and that faggot really made 
            my day. I actually couldn't sleep at all today, my mind was
            so out of it and hanging out with you and Daxen was actually super 
            duper sigma ohio skibidi rizz.
